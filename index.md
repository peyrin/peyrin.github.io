## Projects

* 2020-2021: [*Computer Security*](https://textbook.cs161.org/), the CS 161 course textbook.
* 2020-2021: [CS 161 Exam Archive](https://cs161.org/resources.html#past-exams), fully annotated solutions for over 30 past exams.


## Teaching responsibilities

* Co-developed [new lecture slides](https://su21.cs161.org/) with a focus on accessibility for CS 161.
* Redesigned [project specs](https://cs161.org/proj1/) to provide additional scaffolding and quality-of-life improvements. Average wait time in office hours decreased from 2+ hours to less than an hour as a result of redeveloped projects.
* Developed backend infrastructure to provide additional support to struggling students, including periodic check-ins throughout the semester and support for incomplete students finishing the class in a later semester.
* Wrote/edited exams for CS 161 (since spring 2020) and CS 61C (since fall 2021).
* Rewrote homework assignments for CS 161 to support online learning.
